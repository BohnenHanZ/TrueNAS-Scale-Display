I just wanted to add a small display for my truenas (scale) server to see free space and max hdd temperature and two leds (green/red) to see if the zfs is ok

The display and the leds are connected by a single usb this connection also powers the esp32 - as it's using the builtin linux usb/serial driver no specials drivers are needed.
